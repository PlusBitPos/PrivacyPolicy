**Introduction**

**PlusBit** is a simple and secure multicurrency wallet to store, receive and send cryptocurrencies. Your keys your assets. 

PlusBit (“us”, “we”, or “our”) operates ​https://plusbit.tech​ (the “App”, "Service" or “Site”). This document informs you, the user, of our policies in regards to the collection, use, and disclosure of any Personal Information we may receive from users of our App.

By using the PlusBit App, you agree to the use of aforementioned information in accordance with this policy (the PlusBit Privacy Policy).

**Information Collection and Use**

When using our App, we collect and/or store the following information:

- Account username
- Account password

Account usernames and passwords are stored to allow the App to function as designed. PlusBit uses your username & password to generate your addresses and access funds. Your username + password is your backup phrase. Don't share it with anyone! A single different character in username or password will create a different set of addresses (e.g. a capitalization, space, order of numbers, etc.). Ensure you secure your EXACT username + password to access your account. Store in a secure location. This is your only backup option to restore PlusBit.

There are individual private keys in WIF (wallet import format) for each asset. Back up each WIF private key that holds assets to maximum protection. Go to Settings tab, click the Private Keys, print your backup document and store securely.

As a results, it is the responsibility of the user to properly manage their credentials. If they are lost, it is not possible to access your account. Again, this is why it is a good idea to back up this data in a safe place. If you don’t own your private keys, you don’t own your bitcoins or any other altcoin. So even if you lose your password and username, you can recover your money with your private key.

PlusBit will never share, sell, or otherwise divulge your personal information to any third-party or institution - outside what is set forth in these policies.
